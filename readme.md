# Telco Customer Churn

Hello, In this project I will make prediction of customer churn case. Customer churn basically is a condition where the customer leaves the service provided by the company. So, this situation surely bad for the company if the amount of that is totally large and I as a data scientist are tasked with creating a system model that can predict whether a customer will leave or not through several traits or features that have been trained by the model.

This example dataset that I used come from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) (you can visit that link). Inside the notebook, i include deployment URL to simulate or to try prediction with your new data. In this project I use Indoesian language.
